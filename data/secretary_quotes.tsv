Q-2025-0001	8/22/2025	speech	Secretary Doug Collins Speech	2025 American Legion National Convention	https://youtu.be/cJ0PiMDYmuk?feature=shared	"I'm here to tell you this morning that there is a new day at the VA, because we have changed from an organizational focus on how many employees we have and how many our FTE counts on.  We're changing the metric. The metric is no longer how big we are. The metric is, “How well are we taking care of Veterans?” And that is our only measure of success anymore. I am tired of a country, and if there's media in the room or others who are listening to me, you've heard me say it before, but I'm going to say it again.  I've heard it said that we “give” our Veterans so much, we're “giving” our Veterans this, and we're “giving” our Veterans that. I don't know about you here in Tampa today, but I don't know a Veteran that’s been “given” anything. They have earned everything that they have gotten from this country—when they raised their right hand and said, “We will serve this country,” they have earned every bit of it!  It's time we remember that. And it's time you have a VA that understands that. It's time that you have a VA that puts you first. It's time for a VA that says, you know, when we look at this, we're going to take care of our Veterans. It's also time— and it's good to have, isn't it— a President who actually stands up and says, I love our Veterans, and also a President who says, I love that flag right there, and I'll make sure that I defend it.  That's what a President Trump administration looks like. And we're here this morning to celebrate that."	It’s time Veterans had a system that puts them first. And that’s what they’re getting—because they’ve earned it.

Q-2025-0002	8/22/2025	speech	Secretary Doug Collins Speech	2025 American Legion National Convention	https://youtu.be/w0yU0mXbPTw?feature=shared	"it's more than just saying that we're going to change something. It's actually saying, “What are you going to do, and how are you going to do it, and what are the results?” And that's the whole focus that I've had since I have been at the VA.  It is saying, what are we doing, and how are we doing it? I have become— and I've spoken to this in many groups, and I've heard it. Some of you may have heard me say this before. I had become, like, one of the largest toddlers that you've ever seen. Not that I literally am, although some in the press and some of our detractors would like to say that.  I've asked, “Why?” Why do we do this? How many of you, when you have dealt with the VA, you ask, “Why are we going through this?” “Why is this so difficult?” “Why is it so hard?” Well, I'm going to tell you right now, I have a goal, and it may seem pie in the sky to you. It may even seem pie in the sky to Congress.  It may be pie in the sky to the press. But I really don't care. Because there should be a time in this country, that never be going forward, in which a Veteran who has earned the benefit from the VA should have to go to anybody to get that benefit. It should be easy, simple, and quick that if you've earned it, you get it,  you don't have to go through the bureaucratic maze of the VA to get what you've already earned. We need to do better, and the VA is going to do better."	"It may seem like a pie in the sky idea to some, but it should never be hard for Veterans to get their @DeptVetAffairs benefits. If you've earned it, you get it."	Veteran Benefits | VA Reform | Bureaucracy | Accountability | Accessibility | Policy Goals | Service Improvement |	unused
Q-2025-0003	8/22/2025	speech	Secretary Doug Collins Speech	2025 American Legion National Convention	https://youtu.be/JEfHJs_W4Xo?feature=shared	"When I came into office, one of the issues was backlog. How many of you— you've just, you've probably had your claim, and it took forever. And I've heard— I've heard it before. “It took forever. I never got it.” When I got to the VA, there was 260,000 backlogged disability claims that were over 125 days, over 125 days... 260,000.  I said, why aren’t we doing this? “Well, we've got a lot of work, Mr. Secretary.” “There's a lot of things going on, Mr. Secretary. We got this...” I said, that's bull crap. We're not worried about what we're doing. We worry about our Veterans not getting the help that they deserve. So we put an intense focus on it. We put overtime on it.  And I'm here to report to you today that in just a little over four and a half months, we have dropped it from 260,000 to 1— under 150,000. And it is falling every day.  And we've also, on the other end, before some say, “Well, what about the overall number?” When I first got there, it was over a million claims that were still to be processed. We're now under 700,000 that are being processed. We are making a difference because we've done one thing and one thing different. The VA no longer works for itself.  The VA works for the Veteran of the United States of America."	.@DeptVetAffairs now has one focus—getting Veterans the benefits they've earned. And that’s why we’re processing disability claims faster than ever before.
