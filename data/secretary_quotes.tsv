Q-2025-0001	8/22/2025	speech	Secretary Doug Collins Speech	2025 American Legion National Convention	https://youtu.be/cJ0PiMDYmuk?feature=shared	"I'm here to tell you this morning that there is a new day at the VA, because we have changed from an organizational focus on how many employees we have and how many our FTE counts on.  We're changing the metric. The metric is no longer how big we are. The metric is, ‚ÄúHow well are we taking care of Veterans?‚Äù And that is our only measure of success anymore. I am tired of a country, and if there's media in the room or others who are listening to me, you've heard me say it before, but I'm going to say it again.  I've heard it said that we ‚Äúgive‚Äù our Veterans so much, we're ‚Äúgiving‚Äù our Veterans this, and we're ‚Äúgiving‚Äù our Veterans that. I don't know about you here in Tampa today, but I don't know a Veteran that‚Äôs been ‚Äúgiven‚Äù anything. They have earned everything that they have gotten from this country‚Äîwhen they raised their right hand and said, ‚ÄúWe will serve this country,‚Äù they have earned every bit of it!  It's time we remember that. And it's time you have a VA that understands that. It's time that you have a VA that puts you first. It's time for a VA that says, you know, when we look at this, we're going to take care of our Veterans. It's also time‚Äî and it's good to have, isn't it‚Äî a President who actually stands up and says, I love our Veterans, and also a President who says, I love that flag right there, and I'll make sure that I defend it.  That's what a President Trump administration looks like. And we're here this morning to celebrate that."	It‚Äôs time Veterans had a system that puts them first. And that‚Äôs what they‚Äôre getting‚Äîbecause they‚Äôve earned it.

Q-2025-0002	8/22/2025	speech	Secretary Doug Collins Speech	2025 American Legion National Convention	https://youtu.be/w0yU0mXbPTw?feature=shared	"it's more than just saying that we're going to change something. It's actually saying, ‚ÄúWhat are you going to do, and how are you going to do it, and what are the results?‚Äù And that's the whole focus that I've had since I have been at the VA.  It is saying, what are we doing, and how are we doing it? I have become‚Äî and I've spoken to this in many groups, and I've heard it. Some of you may have heard me say this before. I had become, like, one of the largest toddlers that you've ever seen. Not that I literally am, although some in the press and some of our detractors would like to say that.  I've asked, ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù Why do we do this? How many of you, when you have dealt with the VA, you ask, ‚ÄúWhy are we going through this?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy is this so difficult?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy is it so hard?‚Äù Well, I'm going to tell you right now, I have a goal, and it may seem pie in the sky to you. It may even seem pie in the sky to Congress.  It may be pie in the sky to the press. But I really don't care. Because there should be a time in this country, that never be going forward, in which a Veteran who has earned the benefit from the VA should have to go to anybody to get that benefit. It should be easy, simple, and quick that if you've earned it, you get it,  you don't have to go through the bureaucratic maze of the VA to get what you've already earned. We need to do better, and the VA is going to do better."	"It may seem like a pie in the sky idea to some, but it should never be hard for Veterans to get their @DeptVetAffairs benefits. If you've earned it, you get it."	Veteran Benefits | VA Reform | Bureaucracy | Accountability | Accessibility | Policy Goals | Service Improvement |	unused
Q-2025-0003	8/22/2025	speech	Secretary Doug Collins Speech	2025 American Legion National Convention	https://youtu.be/JEfHJs_W4Xo?feature=shared	"When I came into office, one of the issues was backlog. How many of you‚Äî you've just, you've probably had your claim, and it took forever. And I've heard‚Äî I've heard it before. ‚ÄúIt took forever. I never got it.‚Äù When I got to the VA, there was 260,000 backlogged disability claims that were over 125 days, over 125 days... 260,000.  I said, why aren‚Äôt we doing this? ‚ÄúWell, we've got a lot of work, Mr. Secretary.‚Äù ‚ÄúThere's a lot of things going on, Mr. Secretary. We got this...‚Äù I said, that's bull crap. We're not worried about what we're doing. We worry about our Veterans not getting the help that they deserve. So we put an intense focus on it. We put overtime on it.  And I'm here to report to you today that in just a little over four and a half months, we have dropped it from 260,000 to 1‚Äî under 150,000. And it is falling every day.  And we've also, on the other end, before some say, ‚ÄúWell, what about the overall number?‚Äù When I first got there, it was over a million claims that were still to be processed. We're now under 700,000 that are being processed. We are making a difference because we've done one thing and one thing different. The VA no longer works for itself.  The VA works for the Veteran of the United States of America."	.@DeptVetAffairs now has one focus‚Äîgetting Veterans the benefits they've earned. And that‚Äôs why we‚Äôre processing disability claims faster than ever before.

And I was a member of Congress for eight years, so I understood this. Congress tends to like to talk about a problem,  think theyÔøΩve solved it, and then complain about it... and then try and solve it again. I think we need to cut the middle person out here. I think we need to find a problem and what? Solve it! But you know, that puts you at odds with the folks who didn't want us to do that. And so I've taken a lot of heat.  I've taken a lot of bad press I'm really upset about. [laughter] I came this morning, and you up here in the close here, and that you can see, I actually, you know, from someÔøΩ if you read the press reports or read the Reddit columns about meÔøΩ that I have actual horns. I sawed them off this morning. [laughter] But you know what?  I'll take criticism from members of Congress. I'll take criticism from the press. But I'm going to tell you right now there's a new day at the VA. If you're a member of Congress, you're a member of the press, or you're a member of my employees or anybody else, and you want to talk bad and lie about the VA, then you're going to hear from me.  Because the day of lying about the VA and lying about our employees is over. It is time we stand up and be the best health care system we can be, because that is what the Veteran deserves. And I will tell anybody that's the truth, and I will not stop fighting for the Veteran of this United States. Attack me all you want.  Attack what we donÔøΩt, but you're not going to question my commitment to the Veteran of this country, because at the end of the day, have you ever thought about itÔøΩ why this organization grew so much, but yet wait times were going up, disability backlogs were going up? It's not about how many people we have. It's about are we actually giving a service to the ones that we're supposed to be about?  The VA is a service organization, not an employment agency."

Q-2025-0005	8/22/2025	speech	Secretary Doug Collins Speech	2025 American Legion National Convention	https://youtu.be/H7OiHYOPnyI?feature=shared	"So my hope is, is that if we started this new day, that we're going to continue to see it, because I'm actually telling our employees it's time to be leaders. I'm going to our hospitals and our hospital center directors and say, it's time for you to lead and quit worrying about other things. Let's quit worrying about the organization. It's time for you to make decisions that are best for our Veterans, and I'm hoping you're going to see it in your local VAMCs and in your local clinics.  They're going to make decisions at the lowest level. Is that not what the military taught us? Solve problems at the lowest level. Quit pushing it up. If it gets to my desk, I'm going to make a decision, and you're probably not going to be real happy about it. But we've got to get better."	"IÔøΩm telling our @DepVetAffairs employees that itÔøΩs time to be leaders. Solve problems at the lowest level and make decisions that are best for Veterans, not VA."

Q-2025-0006	8/22/2025	speech	Secretary Doug Collins Speech	2025 American Legion National Convention	https://youtu.be/tUCZG7SeNsg?feature=shared	"MISSION Act, which was signed on a stage just like this by President Trump, said that there is an area in which we are going to use community care to make sure the Veterans of this country get the help that they need. And you've had others tell you about community care,  but I'm going to tell you over the last four years, unfortunately, they decided community care was not in theÔøΩ in the cards for most of our Veterans. They wanted to keep everybody in the VA. They wanted to hoard and build a little fiefdom. Well, I'm going to tell you this. At the VA now, we're going to fully implement the MISSION Act. We're not only going to implement it, we're going to actually put it into work because there's no fiefdom building at the VA.  I'm all about the Veteran and getting you service and community care. ItÔøΩs the center point of our direct care and our community care work hand in hand, you will get the care you need without the bureaucracy that you've been having to eat for years. How do we do that? We made ÔøΩbest medical interestÔøΩ a standard now, so that if a doctor and you come together and you decide that the best medical interest for you is to go to the community, that doctor can say it is in the best medical interest for you to go to see a community doctor.  You don't have to worry about wait times. You don't have to worry about miles driving. You just simply go to the community care doctor, and we're going to make sure that you get that community care. And also, for some of you who've gotten the... ÔøΩreferrals for six months.ÔøΩ That is the most asinine thing I've ever heard of in my life.  So again, instead of telling you it's bad, we did what? We... [one response] Okay, IÔøΩ thank you for the front row. God bless you. So we're all going to participate. Are we all ready to be a choir this morning? One more time. Are we ready? [affirmative] If you find a problem, you do what? [audience: ÔøΩSolve it!ÔøΩ] If you find a problem, you do what? [audience: ÔøΩSolve it!ÔøΩ] That's what we do.  So we took six months and we took 30 more specialties, and we included them out to one year so that you don't have to keep running back and forth between the VA and a community care. We made it simpler. Why? Because it's about the Veteran. When you put the Veteran first, you start thinking differently. You start putting the Veteran first,  You start wondering about them and not us. And those are the things that we're going to continue to do."

And it's time that we actually begin to look at the VA on how do we help that? Because we have young families who are getting out and transitioning out. They have jobs, they have places in the community. They can't get to the VA between the normal working hours. So we've added just in the last few monthsó we've added over a million extra extended hours across the VA system to take care of people after hours and on Saturdays and Sundays, so that no Veteran who wants to get to the VA will be left out.  We're thinking outside of the box and we're doing it because you matter."	Many of our Veterans canít get to @DeptVetAffairs during working hours. Thatís why weíre adding extended hours across the VA system.

Some have actually went on VA property... and taken their own life. No matter what number you use, I am firmly convinced that one is too many.  I'm firmly convinced that if we as a society and we as a government called the VA do not care, then the rest of the world will not give a damn about us. It is us that has to take the priority. It is this VA that has to take priority. And it is you inó back home, in your communities, in your town halls, in your places where you go to worship, in your places of lodge.  Everywhere you go, you've got to take the accountability for each other, because if we don't, then we'll continue to lose them. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten. 11. 12. 13. 14.  15.  16.  17.  At the end of this day... will not be with us anymore. Not every week. Not every month. Today. So, as we gather to celebrate the Legion coming together.  The VA doing what it's supposed to do. And that's to take care of Veterans and quit worrying about the bureaucracy.  I challenge each of you.  When you get up in the morning or before you go to bed in the evening. Count to 17. And then say, ìI will be the one. I won't take îI'm fineî for an answer any longer. And I'll commit to you. As Secretary of VA, I will wake up every day with one thing, and one thing on my mind. Itís, ìHow do I do what the President told me to do?î  I'm going to take care of Veterans, and that's all I'm going to do."	Even one Veteran suicide a day is too many.
